:partying_face: **Exciting News!** :rocket:

I'm thrilled to share that not one, but two of my pull requests were successfully merged during Hacktoberfest 2023! :tada: As a token of appreciation, I've proudly earned the exclusive Level 2 Hacktoberfest badge! :medal:

### Pull Request 1: ZenML CLI Typo Fix
During the Hacktoberfest event, I fixed a common CLI command typo in ZenML. My contribution involved changing "zenml pipelines list" to "zenml pipeline list." Every small change counts in our journey of giving back to the tech community! :muscle:

A huge shoutout to the Hacktoberfest team for the Level 1 badge that motivated me to aim higher! :fire: #OpenSource #Hacktoberfest #LevelUp #GitHub #Contributor #Programming #Coding #TechCommunity #ZenML

:deciduous_tree: **Pull Request 2: Tree Planting Reward**
But wait, there's more! :deciduous_tree: As a delightful reward for my open-source contributions, I received a tree planted in my name through Tree-Nation. This Markhamia lutea now stands tall in the Usambara Biodiversity Conservation project in Tanzania! :earth_africa::herb:

:partying_face: **Exciting News: Level 2 Badge Unlocked in Hacktoberfest 2023!** :rocket::tada:

I'm thrilled to announce that my recent pull request in the Evidently AI repository has earned me the prestigious Level 2 Hacktoberfest badge! :trophy:

### Pull Request: Evidently AI Repository Enhancement
In my contribution, I made a subtle yet impactful change by updating the display name for DatasetCorrelationsMetric() to "Dataset Correlations" in the title. This small improvement enhances clarity and consistency in the project. :briefcase::wrench:
